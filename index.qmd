## Bio

I'm a professor of Statistics and Data Science working to provide data science expertise and education to everyone using data to make sense of the world.

<!-- ## Key research interests -->

<!-- -   **Computational epidemiology**: agent-based modelling, disease-avoidant behaviours, epidemics over dynamic networks, geospatial computational epidemiology -- all primarily in the context of infectious diseases -->
<!-- -   **Pharmacovigilance**: VAERS, passive reporting, text mining of large complex report sets using LLMs -->
<!-- -   **Computational dynamics**: computational dynamics of complex systems, computational dynamics of infectious diseases, computational dynamics of social systems -->
<!-- -   **Public health**: evidence-based public health policy, public health ethics, public health law, quality and systems improvement in public health -->

<!-- ## Teaching -->

<!-- I am a visiting thesis supervisor for students on the data science track of the mathematics programme at the [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://www.bme.hu/?language=en) - you can read more about this [here](teaching). -->

<!-- From time to time, I get invited to give talks and lectures. My capacity for this is somewhat limited due to other commitments, but if you are interested in having me speak at your event, please [get in touch](mailto:chris+website@chrisvoncsefalvay.com). -->

<!-- ## Professional affiliations -->

<!-- [**The OR Society**](https://www.theorsociety.com/) \| Member since 2020 -->

<!-- [**Royal Society for Public Health**](https://www.rsph.org.uk/) \| Fellow since 2021 -->

<!-- [**TOPRA**](https://www.topra.org/) \| Registered Member since 2021 -->

<!-- ## Personal life -->

<!-- I live in Denver, CO, with my Golden Retriever, Oliver. Born in Budapest, Hungary, I've spent my formative years in England, but have called the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Austria and the United States home at various points in my life. Since 2020, I've been living in the United States, where I am a permanent resident. -->

<!-- In my free time, I enjoy reading (mostly Cold War history and classical Greek drama), cooking (with not a lot of success) and Renaissance polyphony (esp. Thomas Tallis and Orlando di Lasso). I'm credited for a somewhat pretty sequence of integers called Jellyfish Heart numbers ([OEIS A344856](https://oeis.org/A344856)), which I discovered in 2020 while doing something that has nothing at all to do with my day job. -->

<!-- I live with [neuromyelitis optica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromyelitis_optica) since 2015, which has left me with a lifelong desire to understand complex, multicausal health conditions like NMOSD better. -->

<!-- ## Pronunciation guide -->

<!-- My last name rhymes with Chick-Fil-A. -->
