    "text": "Hey! It’s great to meet you. I’m a Professor of Statistics and Data Science at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, CA. I’m passionate about\n\nData Science (Education)\nStatistical Computing (Education)\nFine Dining (though mostly food in general)\nCraft Cocktails\n\nI hope we can help each other! Let’s reduce degrees of separation from the things we’re both interested in, by having connected with each other. Even if it’s not a passion of mine, I’m happy to share what I’ve heard with you.\nI’ve been in Data Science since I started college in 2005 at Cal Poly. I’ve always enjoyed being on the computer, working with data, and helping people. Although my degrees are all technically in Statistics, I’ve enjoyed a heavy computing element using C++, SAS, R, and Python to address any number of data-related projects.\nDepending on your own background, current position, and interests you may be curious about different dimensions of what I’ve been up to. So, I’ve organized it all into Academic, Professional, and Personal. I’m also excited to be documenting some recent thoughts in a Blog.\nIf you’re interested in Data Science Education then be sure to check out the recently published Data Science for All (displayed to the right). If you have questions or want to discuss further then please reach out to me via email.\nIf you’re interested in consulting, professional development, corporate training, or contract work then please feel free to reach out to me via email."
